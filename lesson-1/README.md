# Lesson #1
## Environment Setup, HTML & CSS
Welcome to Scope Fall 2019! This semester we'll be learning the React, which is a JavaScript library for creating single page applications. In this lesson we will dive into the React ecosystem, creating your first React application.

## Setup

### Editor
For the lessons, you will need a text editor or an IDE and terminal (command line tool). We recommend using the flexible open-source editor Atom, which can be downloaded [here](https://atom.io/).

### Node and NPM
Now you will need to install [node and npm (node package manager)](https://nodejs.org/en/). These will be used to manage libraries and packages. Install the package and follow the instructions that are prompted upon opening.

Verify both have been installed by running the following commands in your terminal.  If you don't get any output in the terminal, you need to install node and npm.

```
	node --version
	*v10.16.2
	npm --version
	*v6.9.0
```

### React
Now type the following command to install React, React DOM, and a sample React app.

```
	npx create-react-app my-app
	cd my-app
	npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000/ in your favorite browser to see your app.
