# Lesson #2: JavaScript & React Project Structure
In this lesson we will learn about JavaScript and work with the ``my-app`` project we created last week in order to understand React and the project structure.

## JavaScript
JavaScript makes web pages dynamic.

### Syntax
Declare variables with var.

```js
var someVar = 5;
```
Variable types: number, string, boolean, object

```js
var myObj = {
	key1: "Hello",
	key2: "world."
};
```

Function syntax:

```js
function myFunction(thing){
	return thing.toUpperCase();
}

myFunction(foo);
```

## React


### If you weren't here last week:

Type the following command to install React, React DOM, and a sample React app.

```
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000/ in your favorite browser to see your app.
