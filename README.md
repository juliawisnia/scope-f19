# Scope Fall 2019: React

This is the Scope Spring 2019 GitHub curriculum repository! Here you'll find projects and resources that will help you learn React. The repository contains a folder for every lesson. Within each folder is a project and a `README.md` that will guide you step-by-step on how to build the project for that lesson.

### Curriculum Outline
* [**Lesson 1**](lesson-1) - Environment Setup, HTML & CSS
* [**Lesson 2**](lesson-2) - JavaScript & React Project Structure
* [**Lesson 3**](lesson-3) - React
* [**Lesson 4**](lesson-4) - React
* [**Lesson 5**](lesson-5) - React

### Using This Repo
To use this repo properly, first follow [lesson 1](lesson-1/README.md) to get Git, Node, React, and the right environment setup on your machine.

For every lesson, there's a project and a `README.md` that corresponds to that project. The project will contain the full finished code for that lesson and the `README.md` will walk you step-by-step on how to build that week's project from scratch.

We hope you'll follow along our curriculum and get started building Web apps. It's going to be a fun semester and we're glad you're a part of it!
